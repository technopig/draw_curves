# Draw those straight-line curve drawings
You know - the ones from middle school.

Python version is `Python 3.9.0`

I recommend using a virtual environment. In the project folder:

```
$ python3 -m venv ./venv
```

Then activate the environment:

```
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```

> Note: To deactivate, just type in `deactivate` or exit the terminal.

Then install the requirements:

```
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then just mess around with the variables at the top of the script, and run it:

```
(venv)$ python draw.py
```
